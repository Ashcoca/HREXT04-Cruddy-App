## OFFICIAL FEATURE LIST
Please note I added a second app idea in the event that this first one isn't suitable
for the requirements of this project.


## App Goal:   
HREXT04 Yearbook. I certainly had a great time with everyone, I thought it
might be a neat idea to commemorate the end of our time together the same
way we did back in grade school - with a yearbook. I figure I can get in
touch with everyone in the class to help contribute bits, like stories
or something.

Features:
- [ ] - [ ] - Intro detailing who we are and what we're about
- [ ] - [ ] - Searchable database of all members (list.js)
- [ ] - [ ] - Profile info for each user
- [ ] - [ ] - Photo of user for profile
- [ ] - [ ] - Link to github for each user
- [ ] - [ ] - Quote or funny story or something that I can get them to contribute
- [ ] - [ ] - Mouse over user for something silly, like their favorite animal
- [ ] - [ ] - Highlights from the year
- [ ] - [ ] - Pages for staff members
- [ ] - [ ] - Ability to leave comments (something like the twittler tweet bit)
- [ ] - [ ] - Auto complete when searching?
- [ ] - [ ] - Maybe a way to see all members at once? Like a big grid with everyone's pics
- [ ] - [ ] - Pagination for grid, maybe 10 profile pics at a time
- [ ] - [ ] - Add chart showing how each person spent their time during the extended program (like the example we worked on I suppose) Maybe that could be an on-click feature somehow

I'm not sure what other features to include. You know, this idea probably isn't exaclty
on point, but I do think it's really cute. I'm also not sure if it's going to be really
hard or if it's going to be really easy...



## Backup App goal:

I'd like to make a trivia app, one that gives you multiple choice answers
and maybe mocks you a little like how You Don't Know Jack would. I wonder
if I could incorporate multiplayer somehow? Probably not at this stage,
but I could definitely have a leaderboard that displays! I'm thinking
the longer you take to answer the less points you get too.

- [P] - [D] Priority - Difficulty

- [1] - [3] Opening site animation
- [9] - [2] Start Quiz/See Leaderboard option to start
- [9] - [4] Display Questions
- [5] - [9] Timer (10 seconds) to lock in answer
- [1] - [9] Fade out wrong answers as timer goes down
- [7] - [6] Display points earned for right answer
- [5] - [9] Display information on correct answer (history/background) Might be hard
- [9] - [3] Display and store total score
- [7] - [5] Allow entry of name to append to leaderboard at end (3 letters only)
- [7] - [5] Display leaderboard
- [9] - [3] Congratulations (dancing corgi?) for players who qualify for leaderboard
- [1] - [3] Sound for correct answer or wrong answer
- [3] - [5] Add page for contributing questions for trivia

I put some of these things as 9's if I didn't know how to do them, but most likely
they'll end up being a lot simpler than I think.
